# Space-Site-Analysis

Overview

In this project, I have analysed below requirements using the visualization tool named Tableau. It  is one of the fastest growing data visualization tools which is currently being used in the Business intelligence industry. It is the best way to change or transform the raw set of data into an easily understandable format with zero technical skills and coding knowledge.

Requirements:- 

1. What are the average temperature details of the launch sites ?
2. What are the average Wind speed details of the launch sites ?
3. What are the average Humidity details of the launch sites ?
4. What are the different varieties of launch vehicles used by diferent companies ?
5. What is the Mission status of the company ?
6. Track record of the launch site ?
